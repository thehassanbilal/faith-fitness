Description:
When you’re looking for cell volumizing, skin splitting pump, look no further than Animal Pump.  The “pump” is perhaps the most important physiological process as it relates to the bodybuilder and the pursuit of muscle-building. Not only is it the gratifying feeling of skin-tearing fullness that keeps iron athletes returning to the gym day after day, it is also the means by which oxygen and nutrient-rich blood engorges working muscle, feeding it so that it can grow. Not only does it make you look bigger, blowing up the target muscle group like a balloon, it actually makes you bigger, triggering the process of anabolism. This process of muscle volumization is critical to muscle growth. With Animal Pump, we at Animal designed a formula specifically to “up the volume” while improving performance. Animal Pump was the first encapsulated pre-workout formula that contained a full daily dose of advanced creatines in each pre-dosed pack, fortified by vasodilation ingredients intended to maximize the pump by boosting nitric oxide (NO) production.
