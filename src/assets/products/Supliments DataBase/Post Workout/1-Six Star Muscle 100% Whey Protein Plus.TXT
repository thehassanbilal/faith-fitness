HOW IT WORKS
When you exercise, your body requires more protein to help your muscles recover and develop. Six Star® 100% Whey Protein Plus supplies your body with a mega-dose of fast-absorbing whey protein to address that demand. When digested, protein is broken down into amino acids (the building blocks of muscle), which proceed to repair muscle tissue and promote growth. Six Star 100% Whey Protein Plus is also enhanced with creatine, a scientifically proven muscle and strength builder. Creatine promotes the replenishment of your body’s energy stores, thus further accelerating muscle recovery.*
